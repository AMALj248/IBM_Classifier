# IBM_Classifier
Bank Loan Prediction used for IBM Course.
In this project i have used KNN , SVM , LogisticRegression , Descion Tree to predict the condtioon of a Bank Loan.
This is a Classification Problem .
I have used LogLoss , Jaccard_Score , F1-Score as Accuracy Metrics .

 Note 1 : Jaccard_Similarity_Score does not seem to work in Pycharm(Python 3.8) so use Jaccard_Score instead.
 
 Note 2 :The .py file should work on Most IDE without any problems while the Watson Studio File should work on Watson(Python 3.6).
